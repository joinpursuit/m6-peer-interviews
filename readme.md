# Peer Mock Interviews

This is a repository to help students practice mock interviews with each other. Half the class will have access to one set of problems. Half will have access to another set.

Pairings should be made such that each pair can give a previously unseen challenge to the other student.

The goal isn't to successfully complete the challenges. The goal is to improve being able to solve problems that have never been seen before by your partner. This is the better preparation for real world interview situations. Therefore, sharing the challenges would diminish the purpose of this practice and is strongly discouraged.

## Instructions

### Google Form

Be sure to share how it went with your instructional team. Please use [this form](https://forms.gle/jyNxiEebzhd8S9RL8).

### Discussion Question

- [Select a discussion question](./discussion-questions.md)

The goal is for you and your partner practice answering these types of questions in order to develop answers that are short, eloquent and impactful.

### Trivia Question

- [select a trivia question](./trivia-list.md)

The goal is for you and your partner to practice talking about code. Be sure to take the time to look up the answer to this question if you are not sure of the answer.

### Coding challenge

Choose a coding challenge for your partner. Spend 5-15 minutes reviewing the solution and be sure you understand it. You can copy the code and add your own comments, run test cases and rewrite the instructions in your own words to help make sure you fully understand the challenge

- Open a new repl.it
- Select new repl
- Choose `node.js`
- Add a new file and name it `readme.md`
- Copy and paste add the challenge instructions - be sure to click the `raw` button on GitHub to see the markdown code and use that to copy so that the formatting is correct into the `readme.md`
- If the problem has starter code (arrays or objects to test etc.), copy those into the `.js` file

The goal is to practice solving interview questions.

## Administering the interview

### Pre-interview checklist

Make sure you have completed all of the following tasks before starting an interview:

- [ ] You have the google form open.
- [ ] You know which discussion question you are asking.
- [ ] You know which trivia question you are asking.
- [ ] You know which coding challenge you are giving.

During the beginning of the interview:

- [ ] You have confirmed your partner has not been asked that coding challenge before.
  - If your partner has seen this question before, it's ok! Decide
    - To do it again and see if your partner can do it a little faster and explain the code better
    - To pick out a different problem
- [ ] You have shared the link to the repl
- [ ] You have a strategy to watch the time

### Giving the interview

#### Welcome your interviewee (1-3 minutes)

Begin by welcoming your partner. Have them confirm that they have a browser open and are ready for the interview.

Share with your partner that you will be taking notes (filling out the form) throughout the interview. This is not indicative of anything going well or badly.

Your goal is to provide an opportunity to practice interviewing. It does not matter if code challenge is solved: it is important that you are supporting your peer in improving their interviewing and problem solving skills.

Lead with empathy and provide feedback that is constructive. Think of providing S.M.A.R.T. goals as feedback

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

Good:

- I think it would be helpful to review these 2 array methods in the next few days, I have this resource that I like, have you seen it?
- I noticed you struggled with asking clarifying questions, try writing down some clarifying questions for the next 2 or 3 problems you solve
- I think it would be better to be sure you finish the answer to your discussion question on a positive note

Bad:

- You should practice coding more
- Your answer to the discussion question could be better

Giving interviews are hard! Think about how you could provide a better experience the next time you do it.

#### Ask the Trivia Question (1-3 minutes)

Provide an answer if your partner is stuck. Move on quickly, so there is enough time for the rest of the interview

#### Ask the discussion question (1-3 minutes)

Ask your partner the discussion question. Ask follow-ups only if your partner has not answered the question. Save feedback until the end so you can be sure to have enough time to do the coding challenge

#### Share the coding challenge (remaining time, but save 5-10 minutes for feedback)

As you are running the coding challenge, keep the following in mind:

- Your partner should do the following: (1) ask clarifying questions, considering edge cases; (2) share how they plan to solve the problem with you (3) talk through what they're doing as they code it; and (4) reflect back on their solution once they are done, running through their code with an example.

  While this is what they should do, you should not prompt them to complete any of these tasks if they skip over something.

- Do not add any additional information to the coding challenge, unless it helps clarify the problem. Do not add additional constraints or challenges.

- If your partner gets stuck, ask them questions to help move them along. If they are not able to get any further, you can stop the interview and proceed to the next section.

#### Providing feedback (5 - 10 minutes)

Once your partner has worked through the challenge/time is up, stop the interview and give them feedback. Consider focusing on two things that went well and one that they should improve for next time. If your partner is having a rough day, it's ok to just give a pep talk, they will have opportunities for more feedback in other mock interviews.

If your partner did not come to a solution, walk through a solution with them.

Add your feedback to the Google Form. Submit the form once you have filled in all required form fields.
